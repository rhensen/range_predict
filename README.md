# range_predict
This is the code to build a Rshiny App to predict rangelands using data from the MRLC 


You will need to store the MLCR rangelelands data unzipped with the orginal names in the same folder that the app.R document is stored. You also will need to download the 2016 NLCD https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mrlc/NLCD_2016_Land_Cover_L48_20190424.zip and name it 2016_NLCD


Data can be downloaded from: 
https://www.mrlc.gov/data?f%5B0%5D=category%3ARangeland%20-%20Future%20Projections%20-%202020s%2C%202050s%2C%20and%202080s

Note that these are very large files and may take up substanial space (over 130gbs once unzipped). 

File names should look like this:
